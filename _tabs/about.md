## Me

I will try to keep it short and simple: I am a Cloud & Software Architect **specialized in AWS**, I have 5 AWS certifications (the 3 associate and the 2 professional) and I work with AWS. You can find more information about my professional experience on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-lazaro-chueca/){:target="_blank"}. Of course, I will be happy to connect with anyone interested.

## The Blog

> You can <kbd>subscribe to the newsletter</kbd> and receive new content periodically.

{: .prompt-tip }

- The main goal is to **create periodic content related to AWS** and share publicly.
- The secondary goal is to have an excuse to keep learning and practicing with AWS resources.
- I like the TLDR summary.
- This is a **personal blog**:
  - All opinions on this blog are personal
  - All the content is created in my free time
  - I don’t want to sell you anything
  - I don’t expect any income from the blog
  - I just want to keep learning, share knowledge and make it publicly accessible
- The technology behind this blog is detailed [here](/posts/the-technology-behind-this-blog/){:target="_blank"}.

> To me, "**play with AWS**" means <kbd>PRACTICE</kbd>, experiment trying something new and <kbd>keep learning</kbd>, so my domain is `playingaws`.
