## Me

I am a Cloud & Solutions Architect specialized in AWS. I started as a developer but evolved to an architect, and now with more than 10 years of experience, I have been involved with different clients in all phases of software development and have worked with all kinds of architectures: monolithic, microservices, event-driven, SOA (service-oriented), serverless, cloud-native... I have also worked on modernization projects, DevOps transformations, and security assessments... I often teach AWS to my co-workers and like to collaborate on anything AWS-related that I can help with. I love serverless, event-driven architectures, DevOps, security and new technology challenges.

Finally, I also have 6 AWS certifications (the 3 associate, the 2 professional and the Security Specialty). You can find more information about my professional experience on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alejandro-lazaro-chueca/){:target="_blank"}. Of course, I will be happy to connect with anyone interested.

- The main goal is to **create periodic content related to AWS** and share it publicly.
- The secondary goal is to have an excuse to keep learning and practicing with AWS resources.
- I like the TLDR summary.
- This is a **personal blog**:
  - All opinions on this blog are personal
  - All the content is created in my free time
  - I don’t want to sell you anything
  - I don’t expect any income from the blog
  - I just want to keep learning, share knowledge and make it publicly accessible
- The technology behind this blog is detailed [here](/posts/the-technology-behind-this-blog/){:target="_blank"}, but this is the architecture:

> To me, "**play with AWS**" means <kbd>PRACTICE</kbd>, experiment trying something new and <kbd>keep learning</kbd>, so my domain is `playingaws`.
