## Me

![me](/assets/img/alejandro_moncayo.jpeg){: width="972" height="589" .w-50 .right}

Iâ€™m `Alejandro LÃ¡zaro Chueca`, a Cloud Solutions Architect, **AWS Community Builder**, and **AWS Ambassador**. Iâ€™m passionate about cloud technology, continuous learning, and sharing knowledge with the community.

On this blog, I publish articles in **English and Spanish** about the AWS ecosystem: best practices, cloud architectures, automation, and real-world experiences from my work as a cloud architect.

Besides writing, I also develop personal projects such as [playingpadel.es](https://playingpadel.es), a free platform where padel players can record matches and track their stats.

I dedicate much of my free time to creating content, projects, and resources that I hope bring value to the community.

## The Blog

- The main goal is to **create periodic content related to AWS** and share it publicly.
- The secondary goal is to have an excuse to `keep learning and practicing` with AWS resources.
- I am a big fan of the simplicity and the `KISS` design principle.
- This is a **personal blog**:
  - All opinions on this blog are personal.
  - All the content is created in my free time.
  - I don't want to sell you anything.
  - I don't expect any income from the blog.
  - I just want to keep learning, share knowledge and make it publicly accessible.
- The technology behind this blog is detailed [here](/posts/the-technology-behind-this-blog/).

> **Playing with AWS** means <kbd>hands-on practice</kbd>, experimenting with new ideas, and <kbd>continuous learning</kbd>. That's what `PlayingAWS` is all about.
