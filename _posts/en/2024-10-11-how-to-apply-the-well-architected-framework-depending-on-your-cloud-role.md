## 1. Introduction

This article explores `how the AWS Well-Architected Framework translates into concrete actions for different roles` within a cloud team. Because while all pillars are important, not every team needs to focus on the same ones.

Are you a developer? Do you work in operations? Are you in charge of security? Are you an architect or part of the DevOps team? This article will help you identify which pillars are most relevant to you, with real-world examples and practical advice.

## 2. Aligning AWS Pillars with Your Role: Who Should Focus on What?

The AWS Well-Architected Framework **applies to everyone working on cloud systems**. However, not all pillars carry the same weight for every role.

In this section, I analyze how each type of team (development, operations, security, DevOps, cloud architecture, and FinOps) can align their responsibilities with the pillars that are most important for their day-to-day work.

> Other roles such as business or product can also be considered, which, although not addressed here, also contribute to the pillars from other perspectives.
>
> - Business: They decide roadmap, budget, vision
> - Product: They prioritize functionalities and user experience
{: .prompt-warning }

The goal is to provide a practical guide: which pillars each team prioritizes, concrete examples, and how they collaborate with each other to build well-designed cloud solutions.

## 4. Conclusion

Applying the AWS Well-Architected Framework is not the responsibility of a single person or team. Each role has a different responsibility, and when everyone works aligned with the appropriate pillars, the results are clear: more robust, secure, efficient, and sustainable architectures.

This mind map diagram, also available online [here](https://whimsical.com/aws-well-architected-framework-v1-1-roles-Cwp3RncSXvdBEYiJeEmt6i){:target="_blank"}, visually summarizes the key concepts we've covered in this article:

![mindmap_article_2](mindmap_article_1_v1.1_roles.png)

In the next article of this series, we'll dive into each of the six pillars of the Framework, exploring their principles, best practices, and how to apply them in real-world scenarios. [Access here](/posts/the-six-pillars-of-aws-well-architected-framework-best-practices-for-cloud-success/).
