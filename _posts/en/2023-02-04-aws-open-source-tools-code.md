## Introduction

This is the last article of a series of 3 about open-source tools and AWS. The current article is about `how open-source tools can help you with your code`: to generate it (IaC), validate it (policy as code and compliance) and analyze it (static analysis/credentials)

I have created the following sections:

- IaC tools
- Analysis code: credentials and static analysis
- Policy as Code
- Compliance

## Generate IaC

This section is about open-source tools that will help you to generate Infrastructure as Code directly from your existing resources.

- <kbd>former2</kbd>: generate IaC `in many different languages (CloudFormation, CDK, Terraform, ...)`
- <kbd>terracognita</kbd>: generates your infrastructure as code `on Terraform configuration`
- <kbd>AirIAM</kbd>: scans existing IAM usage patterns and provides a simple method to `migrate IAM configurations into a right-sized Terraform plan`

### former2

Former2 allows you to generate Infrastructure-as-Code outputs from your existing resources within your AWS account. By making the relevant calls using the AWS JavaScript SDK, Former2 will scan across your infrastructure and present you with a list of resources for you to choose which to generate outputs.

Supported IaC output:

- CloudFormation
- Terraform
- Troposphere
- CDK v1
- CDK v2
- CDK (Terraform)
- Pulumi
- Diagram
- Raw Output (Debug)

> **Why use it**: Generate IaC from AWS account resources created manually using an extension for your browser. You will configure it through the former2.com website.

### terracognita

Reads from existing public and private cloud providers (reverse Terraform) and `generates your infrastructure as code on Terraform configuration`.

Terracognita currently imports AWS, GCP, AzureRM and VMware vSphere cloud providers as Terraform (v1.1.9) resource/state.

### AirIAM

AirIAM scans existing IAM usage patterns and provides a simple method to `migrate IAM configurations into a right-sized Terraform plan`. It identifies unused users, roles, groups, policies and policy attachments and replaces them with a Least Privileges Terraform code modelled to manage AWS IAM.

AirIAM was created to promote immutable and version-controlled IAM management to replace today's manual and error-prone methods.

{: .prompt-warning }

### Summary: Which tool should I use to generate IaC?

- CDK, CloudFormation, Troposphere, Pulumi: **former2**
- Terraform IaC: **former2 or terracognita**
- Specific IAM resources: former2, terracognita or **AirIAM**

## Analyze IaC code: static analysis

> Static Code Analysis commonly refers to the running of Static Code Analysis tools that attempt to `highlight possible vulnerabilities` within â€˜static' (non-running) source code. Information extracted from [OWASP website](https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Static_Code_Analysis){:target="_blank"}
{: .prompt-tip }

- <kbd>checkov</kbd>: Scans cloud infrastructure provisioned to `detect security and compliance misconfigurations` using graph-based scanning.
- <kbd>KICS</kbd>: Find `security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, and infrastructure misconfigurations` early in the development cycle of your infrastructure-as-code
- <kbd>terrascan</kbd>: static code analyzer for Infrastructure as Code to `scan infrastructure as code for misconfigurations, detect security vulnerabilities and compliance violations`
- <kbd>tfsec</kbd>: static analysis code for `Terraform`
- <kbd>cfn-nag</kbd>: looks for patterns in `CloudFormation templates` that may indicate insecure infrastructure.

All the tools in this section allow you to create custom rules

### checkov

Checkov is a `static code analysis tool for infrastructure as code` (IaC) and also a software composition analysis (SCA) tool for images and open-source packages.

It scans cloud infrastructure provisioned to detect `security and compliance misconfigurations` using graph-based scanning.

Checkov scans these IaC file types:

- **Terraform** (for **AWS**, GCP, Azure and OCI)
- **CloudFormation (including AWS SAM)**
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
- Serverless framework
- Helm charts
- Kubernetes
- Docker

Some Features:

- Over 1000 built-in policies cover security and compliance best practices for AWS, Azure and Google Cloud.
  - In AWS there are 177 controls in the framework `CKV_AWS`. Checkov scans for compliance with common industry standards such as
    - the Center for Internet Security (CIS)
    - and Amazon Web Services (AWS) Foundations Benchmark.
- Detects AWS credentials in EC2 user-data, Lambda environment variables and Terraform providers.
- Identifies secrets using regular expressions, keywords, and entropy-based detection.
- Plugins for popular IDEs are available (JetBrains, VSCode and Vim). However, activating the extension requires the submission of a one-time Bridgecrew API Token that can be obtained by creating a new Bridgecrew platform account.

You can create custom policies [here for more information](https://www.checkov.io/3.Custom%20Policies/Custom%20Policies%20Overview.html){:target="_blank"} using Python or YAML.

- KICS: 36 (3 high, 20 medium, 13 low)
- terrascan: 9 (1 high, 7 medium, 1 low)
- tfsec: N/A (only Terraform code)
- cfn-nag: 33

## Analyze IaC code: Policy as Code

> Policy-as-code is the use of code to define and manage rules and conditions to assure that your Infrastructure will be compliance with that.
> This is a way to apply `preventative governance and compliance (shift left)`, validating Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) against your organizational best practices for security and compliance.
{: .prompt-tip }

- <kbd>CloudFormation Guard</kbd>: policy-as-code evaluation tool for general purpose
- <kbd>OPA</kbd>: general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack
- <kbd>Regula</kbd>: evaluates infrastructure as code files for potential security and compliance violations before deployment.

### CloudFormation Guard

AWS CloudFormation Guard is an open-source general-purpose policy-as-code evaluation tool. It provides developers with a `simple-to-use`, yet powerful and expressive domain-specific language (DSL) to define policies and enables developers to validate JSON or YAML formatted structured data with those policies.

Supported: `CloudFormation Templates, CloudFormation ChangeSets, Terraform JSON` configuration files, Kubernetes configurations, and more.

> This is an official aws-cloudformation tool (yet open-source), but you have to create your own rules. I didn't find the "security best practices" included in the control AWS best practices of Security Hub as rules. However, you have here some examples: [https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard/tree/main/guard-examples](https://github.com/aws-cloudformation/cloudformation-guard/tree/main/guard-examples){:target="_blank"}
{: .prompt-warning }

### Open Policy Agent (OPA)

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open-source, general-purpose policy engine that enables unified, context-aware policy enforcement across the entire stack.

The Open Policy Agent is an open-source, general-purpose policy engine that unifies policy enforcement across the stack. OPA provides a high-level declarative language (`REGO`) that lets you specify policy as code and simple APIs to offload policy decision-making from your software. You can use OPA to enforce policies in microservices, Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, API gateways, and more.

OPA ecosystem is huge [here](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/ecosystem/#){:target="_blank"}, but in AWS we can use it to analyze our JSON/YAML file in CloudFormation or our Terraform template by creating custom rules for these languages.

OPA is a project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) landscape.

> **Why use it**: unify policy enforcement across the stack. This example is using [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/policy-enforcement/opa){:target="_blank"}. You have to convert your output Terraform to JSON file and then analyze it with OPA rules:

> You have to create your own OPA rules with REGO language (easy to learn). You have an online playground to test your REGO policies [here](https://play.openpolicyagent.org/){:target="_blank"}
{: .prompt-warning }

### Regula

Regula is a tool that evaluates infrastructure as code files for potential AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and Kubernetes security and compliance violations prior to deployment. `Based on Open Policy Agent` (OPA) and written in REGO

Regula supports the following file types:

- CloudFormation JSON/YAML templates
- Terraform source code (.tf or .tf.json format)
- Terraform JSON plans
- Kubernetes YAML manifests
- Azure Resource Manager (ARM) JSON templates (in preview)

This is the list of rules applied (in AWS there are rules for Terraform and CloudFormation): [https://regula.dev/rules.html](https://regula.dev/rules.html#aws-cloudformation){:class="border"}.
> You must to know that at this time **CloudFormation support 23 controls, and Terraform 114**.
{: .prompt-warning }

[Here](https://regula.dev/development/writing-rules.html){:target="_blank"} you can find more information about `Writing custom rules`.

### Summary: Which tool should I use to create my custom Policy as a Code?

- AWS solution: CloudFormation Guard, OPA or regula
- Cross-provider solution: OPA or regula (both using REGO language)

Or you can use any of the tools in the `static analysis` category because all of them allow you to create custom rules.

## Detect credentials in code

These tools can be applied to any git code:

- General for git repository:
  - <kbd>git-secrets</kbd>: Prevents you from committing passwords and other sensitive information to a git repository.
  - <kbd>gitleaks</kbd>: a tool for detecting and preventing hardcoded secrets like passwords, API keys, and tokens in git repos.
- Specific of IaC code:
  - <kbd>checkov</kbd>: a static code analysis tool for infrastructure as code (including secrets)
    - This tool has been already explained a few lines before so you can get the information from there

### git-secrets

Prevents you from committing passwords and other sensitive information to a git repository.

## Others

- Compliance
  - <kbd>cloud custodian</kbd>: rules engine to define policies to enable a well-managed, secure and cost-optimized cloud infrastructure
- Cost of Terraform templates:
  - <kbd>Infracost</kbd>: estimate cost for Terraform before to deploy

### Cloud custodian

Cloud Custodian is a rules engine to define policies to enable a well-managed, secure and cost-optimized cloud infrastructure in yaml format.

Custodian can be used to manage AWS, Azure, and GCP environments by ensuring `real-time compliance with security policies` (like encryption and access requirements), tag policies, and cost management via garbage collection of unused resources and off-hours resource management.

Custodian policies are written in simple YAML configuration files that enable users to specify policies on a resource type (EC2, ASG, Redshift, CosmosDB, PubSub Topic) and are constructed from a vocabulary of filters and actions.

You can apply to AWS to [here](https://cloudcustodian.io/docs/aws/gettingstarted.html){:target="_blank"}

### Infracost

Infracost shows cloud cost estimates for Terraform. It lets DevOps, SRE and engineers see a cost breakdown and understand costs before making changes, either in the terminal or pull requests.

Infracost also has many CI/CD integrations so you can easily post cost estimates in pull requests. This provides your team with a safety net as people can discuss costs as part of the workflow.

The CDK for Terraform is also supported as it can generate Terraform
