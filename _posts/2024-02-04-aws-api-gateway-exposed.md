## Introduction

You already know what an API (**A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface) is, [what is Amazon API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html){:target="_blank"}, [when choosing between REST and HTTP APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-vs-rest.html){:target="_blank"}, and have experience and don't need [tutorials or workshops](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-tutorials.html){:target="_blank"}.

I neither need to remind you of the `advantages` of using AWS API Gateway (scalability, security, performance, life management,...) nor what the most common `use cases` are (serverless architectures, microservices, data retrieval...).

Then, we can just enter the details of the options for exposing API Gateway. 

We will compare the following options:
1. Standard Endpoint URL: ```https://{api-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage}/count```
2. Custom Domain Names: ```https://{subdomain}.{custom-domain}.com/count```
3. Integration with CloudFront: 
   - Using CloudFront autogenerated DNS: `https://{random-name}.cloudfront.net`
   - Using our custom domain: ```https://{custom-domain}.com/{optional-level}/count```
4. Private Endpoints (VPC Integration): 
   - Invoking your private API using private DNS names: same as Standard Endpoint URL
   - Accessing your private API using a Route53 alias: ```https://{api-id}-{vpce-id}.execute-api.{region}.amazonaws.com/{stage}/count```
   - Invoking your private API using endpoint-specific public DNS hostnames: ```https://{public-dns-hostname}.execute-api.{region}.vpce.amazonaws.com/{stage}```
   - [Here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-private-api-test-invoke-url.html){:target="_blank"} you have more information.

> In the option of `Integration with CloudFront` I will assume we are using also our own domain.

## Detailed Overview of AWS API Gateway Endpoint Exposing Options

1. Standard Endpoint URL
   - Description: This is the `default configuration`. There are 2 API endpoint types related to this option: regional and edge-optimized.
     - When you deploy an edge-optimized API, API Gateway sets up an `Amazon CloudFront distribution` and a DNS record to map the API domain name to the CloudFront distribution domain name. However, you can't configure it.
   - Architectural Impact: Standard endpoints are quick to implement, facilitating agile development. However, they offer limited control over network routing and performance optimizations.

1. Custom Domain Names
   - Description: Custom domain names are `simpler and more intuitive URLs` that you can provide to your API users. A domain that is easy to remember and relevant to your APIâ€™s purpose can significantly enhance user experience and API discoverability. Additionally, it simplifies the process of updating and maintaining APIs, as the endpoint remains constant even if the backend changes.
   - Architectural Impact: Requires additional DNS configuration and SSL/TLS certificates, introducing complexity in domain management but significantly enhancing API discoverability and trustworthiness. It enables a consistent entry point for APIs despite underlying changes.

1. Integration with CloudFront
   - Description: By integrating API Gateway with CloudFront, `APIs benefit from CDN capabilities`, including improved global distribution and caching.
   - Architectural Impact: This approach enhances API performance and availability by leveraging CloudFront's distributed network of edge locations. It involves a more complex setup but offers robust security features and efficient handling of high-traffic volumes.

1. Private Endpoints (VPC Integration)
   - Description: Private endpoints `restrict API access within an AWS Virtual Private Cloud` (VPC), enhancing security for internal APIs.
   - Architectural Impact: Requires a VPC endpoint and it is ideal for microservices architecture within a VPC, ensuring that API traffic does not traverse the public internet. This setup supports enhanced security protocols and network isolation but limits accessibility to internal users or services.

     - `Higher costs` associated with CloudFront usage

4. Private Endpoints (VPC Integration)
   - Advantages:
     - `Network isolation`: Restricts API access within a specified VPC, increasing data privacy and compliance.
     - `Enhanced security` by keeping traffic within the AWS network.
   - Limitations:
     - `Private`. Not accessible from outside the VPC.
     - Requires `additional setup` for VPC and endpoint configuration

## Use case & real-world scenario

1. Standard Endpoint URL
   - Use Case: Ideal for `quick deployments and testing purposes`.
   - Real-World Scenario: A startup quickly prototyping its API backend using standard endpoints to test various features without needing custom domain setups. This approach allows for rapid iterations and effective stage management.

2. Custom Domain Names
   - Use Case: Essential for `public-facing APIs where branding is important`. Enhances professional appearance and memorability.
   - Real-World Scenario: An e-commerce company uses custom domains for its API to ensure a consistent brand experience across its digital platform, improving customer trust and recognition.

3. Integration with CloudFront
   - Use Case: 
     - Public-facing APIs where branding is important.
     - `Performance and fine-grained control over content delivery are crucial`.
     - Avoid [CORS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/how-to-cors.html){:target="_blank"}.
   - Real-World Scenario: 
     - A technical blog (mine) deployed on Amazon S3 using a SPA approach where the CORS was a problem in the past and I wanted to remove them and also improve the solution.
     - A media streaming service uses CloudFront with API Gateway to distribute content globally, reducing latency and improving viewer experience.

4. Private Endpoints (VPC Integration)
   - Use Case: Ideal for `internal APIs and microservices` that should not be exposed publicly.
   - Real-World Scenario: A financial institution leverages private endpoints for secure internal communication between services, ensuring data privacy and compliance.

## Implementation Details for Exposing AWS API Gateway Endpoints

In this section, we will review the implementation steps of each option:

1. Standard Endpoint URL
   1. Create API in API Gateway: Choose either HTTP or REST API and configure it according to your requirements.
   2. Deploy API to a Stage: Set up stages like dev, test, or prod. Deploy your API to these stages.
   3. Access the API: Use the provided default URL to access your API.

2. Custom Domain Names
   1. Register a Domain: Use services like AWS Route 53 or any other domain registrar.
   2. Obtain an SSL Certificate: Get a certificate from AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for HTTPS connections.
   3. Configure Custom Domain in API Gateway: Under the 'Custom Domain Names' section in API Gateway, configure your domain. Associate it with a specific API and stage.
   4. DNS Configuration: Configure the DNS settings in your domain registrar to point to the API Gateway endpoint.
   5. Deployment: Deploy your API to apply these changes.

3. Integration with CloudFront
   1. Create a CloudFront Distribution: In the AWS CloudFront console, create a new distribution.
   2. Set API Gateway as Origin: Use your API Gateway endpoint as the origin. The 'origin path' should be your {stage}.
   3. Create a behavior. 
      - Path pattern: '/api/*'. Then, you have to create a first resource in your API with the name 'api' and then include there your other resources. Example: '/api/count', '/api/contact', ...
      - Origin and origin groups: the API Gateway origin defined in the previous step
      - Cache key and origin requests: Cache policy and origin request policy (recommended). 
        - Cache policy: CachingDisabled
        - Origin request policy: UserAgentRefererHeaders or AllViewExceptHostHeader.
   4. Deploy Distribution: After configuration, deploy the distribution to make it active.

4. Private Endpoints (VPC Integration)
   1. Create a VPC Endpoint: In the VPC console, create a new VPC endpoint for API Gateway.
   2. Set Up Private API in API Gateway: Configure your API to be private and associate it with your VPC endpoint.
   3. Control Access: Use VPC endpoint policies to manage access to the API within your VPC.

### Cost

1. Standard URL:
  - Generally, the `lowest cost` as it uses the basic API Gateway pricing model.
  - Costs are primarily based on the number of API calls and data transfers.

2. Custom Domain:
  - Involves additional costs for domain registration and SSL certificate (if not using AWS Certificate Manager, which offers free SSL certificates).
  - The API Gateway pricing still applies.

3. CloudFront Integration:
   - Additional costs for CloudFront, are primarily based on data transfer and request numbers. CloudFront can incur higher costs for heavy traffic.
   - Standard API Gateway charges also apply.

4. Private Endpoint (VPC):
   - Costs for VPC endpoint usage.
   - Standard API Gateway charges.
   - Potentially lower data transfer costs within the AWS network but additional costs for VPC endpoints.
