## TLDR

This is a practical use case where I will explain step by step how I deployed my blog using Amplify Hosting. I will use the AWS Console to do it.

The source code of my blog (web) is available [here](https://github.com/alazaroc/blog-web/){:target="_blank"}

## Introduction

> *[AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/){:target="_blank"} is a set of purpose-built tools and features that enables frontend web and mobile developers to quickly and easily build full-stack applications on AWS.*
>
> *Amplify provides two services: Amplify Hosting and Amplify Studio.*
>
> - ***Amplify Hosting** provides a git-based workflow for hosting full-stack serverless web apps with continuous deployment.*
> - ***Amplify Studio** is a visual development environment that simplifies the creation of scalable, full-stack web and mobile apps. Use Studio to build your frontend UI with a set of ready-to-use UI components, create an app backend, and then connect the two together.*

> AWS Amplify is the fastest and easiest way to develop and deploy reliable and scalable mobile/web applications on AWS

## How to deploy a web with Amplify

We need to have our code ready to be deployed in a supported repository.

- Supported repositories: GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab and AWS CodeCommit.
- Another option is to deploy manually with drag and drop, Amazon S3 or any URL.

In AWS Console, enter to AWS Amplify service and choose `Amplify Hosting`

a) If you don't have an Amplify app, this screen appears and you have to click on <kbd>Get Started</kbd>

![amplify1.1](amplify-1.1-new.png){:class="border"}

and then choose <kbd>Amplify Hosting</kbd>

![amplify1.2](amplify-1.2-new.png){:class="border"}  

b) If you already have an Amplify resource click on <kbd>New app</kbd> and <kbd>Host web app</kbd>

![amplify2](amplify-2.png){:class="border"}

**Configure Amplify Hosting**:

The first step to setting up Amplify Hosting is to connect your repository. In my case, I chose <kbd>GitHub</kbd>
  ![amplify3](amplify-3.png){:class="border"}

Add repository branch: choose your repository and your branch
  ![amplify4](amplify-4.png){:class="border"}

Configure build settings: Advanced settings are optional, allow you to reference your build image, add environment variables and override default installed packages
  ![amplify5](amplify-5.png){:class="border"}

Review the configuration and click <kbd>Save and deploy</kbd>
  ![amplify6](amplify-6.png){:class="border"}

Now Amplify must be provisioned, built, deployed and verified
  ![amplify7](amplify-7.png){:class="border"}

At this moment an email notification will be sent to your email (at least in the GitHub case)
  ![amplify3.2](amplify-3.2-github.png){:class="border"}

When finished, you will be able to access the new URL generated by Amplify

## How to associate my web with my domain name

We can also set up our Domain Name to our deployed website with Amplify Hosting easily.

To register the domain name I used <kbd>Amazon Route53</kbd>.
> Use **Route53** is not the cheapest option (e.g. I paid $12 to register the new domain with Route53 instead of $1 the first year with GoDaddy), but it's worth it (to me)
{: .prompt-tip }

In the side menu, click <kbd>Domain management</kbd>, and then click <kbd>Add domain</kbd>.

![amplify10](amplify-10-domain.png){:class="border"}

Choose your Domain and click on <kbd>Save</kbd>. As I register my domain with Route53, it appears in the text field when I click on it.

![amplify11](amplify-11.png){:class="border"}

Now you can choose the branch, the subdomains and check for automatic redirect from HTTP to HTTPS, and click <kbd>Save</kbd>.

![amplify12](amplify-12.png){:class="border"}

It may take several minutes to complete. First, you need to create the SSL certificate, then configure the SSL and finally activate it.

![amplify13](amplify-13.png){:class="border"}
![amplify14](amplify-14.png){:class="border"}

If we access the main page we can see that the URL has changed.

![amplify15](amplify-15-web-2.png){:class="border"}

We can now access it with our domain name:

![amplify16](amplify-16-web-2.png){:class="border"}

That's it, quick and easy!
