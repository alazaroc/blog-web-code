📝 Draft Introduction

When I first explored Amazon Q Developer a few months ago, it felt like the beginning of something new: an AI-powered code companion that could help me write and understand code faster. It was my first glimpse into how AI could support developers beyond just autocomplete — and I wrote about that experience here
.

Since then, I’ve kept looking for tools that go a step further. Not just assistants that suggest snippets, but platforms that can actually take your ideas, structure them, and execute changes directly in your project. That’s exactly what I found with Kiro.

In this article, I’ll show you how Kiro works in practice. We’ll move from a simple list of tasks to a fully powered development workflow, using Specs when we need to plan and break down complex features, and Vibes when we’re ready to implement changes directly in code.
