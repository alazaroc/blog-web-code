## TLDR

You already have one or multiple AWS accounts and you want to improve your security approach, the Well-Architected Framework (security pillar) contains a lot of information, [I did a full summary here](/posts/getting-started-with-aws-security/){:target="_blank"}, and you may want to learn about a plan to improve your account.

I will share with you two resources to do it:

- **AWS Security Maturity Model** will allow you to know the recommended actions to strengthen your security posture at every stage of your journey to the cloud
  - Contains 4 phases. The first one "quick wins" allow you fast security improvements
- Article in the AWS security blog: The top 10 most important cloud security tips that Stephen Schmidt, Chief Information Security Officer for AWS, laid out at AWS re:Invent 2019

## AWS Security Maturity Model

It is a valuable resource for reviewing the current status and improving the security of your solutions.

The classification of the different recommendations into the categories depends on the cost and difficulty of implementing the security control, and the positive impact that it will achieve.

> This model is **updated monthly** by AWS. In fact, a month after writing this article I had to update it because the model had changed and all areas of the organization had changed, although the content is the same.

### Introduction

#### Security Frameworks

Multiple frameworks help you design the construction of a plan to provide security to your loads in the cloud.

- [Well Architected Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/){:target="_blank"}
- [NIST CyberSecurity Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/nist/){:target="_blank"}
- [Center for Internet Security (CIS) AWS Foundations](https://d1.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/compliance/AWS_CIS_Foundations_Benchmark.pdf){:target="_blank"}
- [Cloud Adoption Framework](https://aws.amazon.com/professional-services/CAF/){:target="_blank"}

#### How to prioritize

"With so many services, security controls, and recommendations… How do I prioritize? Where do I start?"

> All Quick Win recommendations can be implemented in less than a week.

#### Evolutive path

![evolution-path](evolution-path.png){:class="border"}

### Phase 1. Quick Wins

Quick Wins are the first thing to focus on, controls that you could implement in an organization within a maximum of one or two weeks, and will significantly improve your security standpoint.

### Phase 3. Efficient

There are some controls and recommendations that allow us to manage security in an efficient way.

| Level  | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Security governance | - Perform thread modelling |
| Security assurance | - Create your reports for compliance (such as PCI-DSS) |
| Identity and Access | - Privilege review (Least Privilege) <br>- Tagging strategy <br>- Customer IAM: security of your customers  |
| Threat detection | - Integration with SIEM/SOAR <br>- Network Flows analysis (<kbd>VPC Flow Logs</kbd>) |
| Vulnerability management | - Security champion in development |
| Infrastructure protection | - Image Generation Pipeline <br>- Anti-Malware/EDR <br>- Outbound Traffic Control <br>- Use abstract services (Serverless) |
| Data protection | - Encryption in transit |
| Application security | - <kbd>WAF</kbd> with custom rules <br>- <kbd>Shield Advanced</kbd> Advanced DDoS Mitigation |
| Incident response | - Automate critical and most frequently run Playbooks <br>- Automate deviation correction in configurations <br>-Using infrastructure as Code (<kbd>CloudFormation, CDK</kbd>)  |

### Phase 4. Optimized

And finally, there are those controls and recommendations that allow you to optimize in a **continuous improvement cycle** the security posture every day. It will be characterized by security controls that are often seen in more mature organizations, in terms of security, or large organizations with very demanding requirements.

| Level  | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Security governance | - Forming a Chaos Engineering team (Resilience) <br>- Sharing Security work and responsibility  |
| Security assurance | |
| Identity and Access management | - Context-based access control <br>- IAM Policy Generation Pipeline  |
| Threat detection | - <kbd>Amazon Fraud Detector</kbd> <br>- Integration with additional Intelligence Feeds  |
| Vulnerability management | |
| Infrastructure protection | - Process standardization with Service Catalog |
| Data protection | |
| Application security   | - DevSecOps <br>- Forming a Red Team (Attacker's Point of View) <br> |
| Incident response   | - Automate most playbooks <br>- <kbd>Amazon Detective</kbd>: Root cause analysis <br>- Forming a Blue Team (Incident Response) <br>- Multi-region disaster recovery automation |

## Top 10 recommendations

> These are the top 10 most important cloud security tips that Stephen Schmidt, Chief Information Security Officer for AWS, laid out at AWS re:Invent 2019.
{: .prompt-info }

The original article was written in the AWS blog [here](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/top-10-security-items-to-improve-in-your-aws-account/?trk=c750fe34-f44f-43e1-bcc0-6219228839b9&sc_channel=el){:target="_blank"}.

1. **Configure account contacts**
2. **Use multi-factor authentication (MFA)**
   - is the best way to protect accounts from inappropriate access
3. **No hard-coding secrets**
   - use [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/){:target="_blank"}
   - if you are using java or python you can use [CodeGuru Reviewer](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/11/amazon-codeguru-reviewer-hardcoded-secrets-java-python/){:target="_blank"} to detect secrets in the code
4. **Limit security groups**
   - use [AWS Config](https://aws.amazon.com/config/){:target="_blank"} and [AWS Firewall Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/firewall-manager/){:target="_blank"} to programmatically ensure that the virtual private cloud (VPC) security group configuration is what you intended
5. **Intentional data policies**
   - design your approach to data classification
6. **Centralize CloudTrail logs**
   - [AWS recommends](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-receive-logs-from-multiple-accounts.html){:target="_blank"} that you write logs in an AWS account designated for logging (Log Archive).
   - The permissions on the bucket should prevent deletion of the logs, and they should also be encrypted at rest. Review [how to use AWS to visualize AWS CloudTrail logs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/athena/latest/ug/cloudtrail-logs.html){:target="_blank"}
7. **Validate IAM roles**
   - Use AWS IAM Access Analyzer
8. **Take action on findings**
   - Turn on [AWS Security Hub](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html){:target="_blank"}, [Amazon GuardDuty](https://aws.amazon.com/guardduty/){:target="_blank"}, and [AWS Identity and Access Management Access Analyzer](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/features/analyze-access/){:target="_blank"}.
   - You also need to take action when you see findings
9. **Rotate keys**
10. **Be involved in the dev cycle**
    - “raise the security culture of your organization.”
